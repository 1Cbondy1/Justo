# UT Coding Bootcamp Project III

# Justo - [Deployed on Heroku](https://sleepy-escarpment-65099.herokuapp.com)

## Overview
The market is flooded with platforms that allow businesses and freelancers to connect remotely. Few, however, are marketed towards employers and freelancers with established networks of trusted connections. Even fewer options have robust tracking systems that allow for clear real-time information regarding rates, hours, payment/invoicing, and important dates. Keeping track of these variables can be a major annoyance that ends up costing time and money through simple mistakes and miscommunications.

Justo acts as the go-between for businesses and freelancers. It resembles a simple C2C, where the application acts as an intermediary - keeping all parties on the same timeline and ensuring that fair work is rewarded with fair pay.
